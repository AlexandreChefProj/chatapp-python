Chat app in python using html css as front-end.
Back-end made using flask, tests using pytest.

I'm using [wait-for-it.sh](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it/blob/master/wait-for-it.sh), I didn't do it, and it's the big shell part of the project. It has not been done by me, thank you vishnubob.

It is now fully deployable on docker, or at least it seems, I need to test it more, I'm no dev-ops expert (yet hehe)
